[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5875155.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5875155)

_Radio AGN in Semi-Analytic Environments_ (RAiSE) model for the expansion and evolution of the jets and lobes emanating from extraglactic supermassive black holes. The RAiSE _HD_ (hydrodynamics) version of this model adapts Lagrangian particles from a hydrodynamical simulation to the dynamics from the analytical theory, yielding a physically-based magnetic field structure on both large and local scales. This code release enables the user to generate radio-frequency and X-ray wavelength surface brigtness images of Fanaroff-Riley Type-II radio AGNs across their evolutionary history, including for the jet, active lobe and remnant lobe. Parallised code can be run to generate a catalogue of mock radio AGNs to, for example: run parameter inversions to measure the energetics of observed objects; or produce high-resolution animations for data visualisations. The code is written in Python 2/3 and has detailed documentation and worked examples available on GitHub (https://github.com/rossjturner/RAiSEHD).
